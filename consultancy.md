**Web performance affects all businesses. How does it affect yours?**

I work together with organisations of all sizes to analyse, find, and fix
site-speed issues. How much does a one-second slowdown affect conversion rates?
Are third party scripts impacting engagement? How does site-speed influence
revenues?

It’s my job to help you find out.

Consultancy engagements are designed for specific clients and projects, but they
all combine some or all of the following:

* **Analysis:** You can’t fix what you can’t measure. Let’s work out just how
  site-speed affects your business. Once we have an idea of exactly what web
  performance means for you, we’re far better equipped to make meaningful
  improvements.
* **Audits:** I’m a technical consultant at heart—I have a forensic knowledge of
  how both the network and web browsers work. My audits are famed for their
  extensive, detailed, yet actionable insights, and will uncover everything that
  is working against us.
* **Implementation:** Performance sprints are a highly effective way to realise
  returns _fast_. I’ll work alongside your engineering team to get
  customer-facing site-speed improvements out of the door and earning you money.
  I won’t just find the problems—I’ll fix them.
* **Culture:** You should never need to call pest control twice. I will ensure
  your team is left self-sufficient and able to tackle these issues themselves
  in future. Let’s build a performance culture that bakes site-speed
  considerations into projects from the outset. Let’s make it easy to do the
  right thing.

I pride myself on my ability to work with organisations, not merely for them. So
much so that I wrote [a book about
it](https://gumroad.com/l/questions-for-consultants).
