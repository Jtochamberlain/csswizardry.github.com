I’ve done a lot of great work with a lot of great people, but don’t just take my
word for it—here’s what they had to say about me:

    <p>Harry helped our team level up their scalable CSS architecture skills, and to say that he had a large impact on our work is an understatement. We can’t recommend him enough.</p>

    <p>We approached Harry as although we had a good grasp of the fundamentals of web performance as a team, we needed to dig deeper. We got Harry in for a two day on-site and were hugely impressed by the depth and breadth Harry was able to cover in such a short time. Crucially, we were left with a long list of tangible actions to take away which have since resulted in a measurable improvement in the performance of our sites across the board.</p>

  <blockquote class="pull-quote">
    <p>When we first connected with Harry, he was a totally unknown quantity to us—he’d simply met one of our UX designers at a conference and mentioned that he might be able to help us with some site-speed issues we were facing. A few weeks later and he was sat in our office in Tallinn, digging into the problems right there alongside our engineers.</p>

    <p>The impact of his work cannot be overstated. Within just a matter of days he’d identified and rolled out fixes that took global load times down from 18 seconds to just six. The results of his work could be seen immediately in our KPIs and showed a severalfold return on investment after no time at all.</p>

    <p>But, he wasn’t ready to stop there: after focusing on tactical and high-return tasks, he turned his attention to longer-term strategic goals, including geographic monitoring and fostering a performance culture within the business. He always spoke about <i>we</i>, fully embedding himself in the team and making himself a core member. It really felt like he was there with us the whole time.</p>

    <p>He works quickly, methodically, and incredibly forensically, and has a wonderful ability to manage both the business- and technical challenges of web performance. Though clearly technically very proficient, his ability to speak in relevant and jargon-free dialogue allowed him to pull all facets of Coingaming together to better understand and support site-speed efforts. From Business Insights to Marketing, Product to Engineering, and right up to me, the CEO, everyone was left aware of the importance and impact that site-speed has on our business.</p>

    <p>He has remained a part of Coingaming in some way for over two years now: we’ve rehired and retained him a number of times to help keep us on the right path as our business scales and evolves, and as we add new products and team members to our family.</p>

  <blockquote class="pull-quote">
    <p>We worked with Harry for one incredible week, in which we created a tailor-made CSS framework from scratch, complete with naming conventions, documentation style, attributions and an object oriented architecture. Pretty impressive, especially considering that we were only three persons: Harry, a designer and a product manager. Harry was the driving force behind the architecture and for every question we asked, he had well-thought out answer. We managed to make decisions very quickly, which enabled us to move extremely fast toward actual implementation. Without sacrificing quality in any way.</p>

    <p>Working with Harry made us confident that what we are building will last and be a pleasure for us to work with, and for the next person joining the project. So far, we are still enforcing the rules and methods, we learned from Harry and we are loving it!</p>

    <p>I’ve worked with Harry on numerous projects over the years and each time he brings huge amounts of value with his detailed knowledge of performance and front-end architecture. Specifically, on the NHSx project, the techniques I learned surrounding ITCSS changed the way I build web applications. Without a doubt, Harry is the consultant you should bring in if you want an authority on how to build well-architected, fast web apps.</p>

    <p>Spending a week with Harry has turned my approach to large CSS projects on its head. For years I’ve struggled to find a way to effectively structure large, complex CSS projects and his ITCSS methodology has delivered. Now I have a small, flexible SASS codebase and more performant CSS. Whilst guiding me with ITCSS, Harry dropped in many nuggets of CSS & SASS wisdom which were excellent and will prove invaluable to me in the future. I now feel equipped to use Sass & CSS in my development workflow with the most challenging projects.</p>
