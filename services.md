workshop was nothing short of fantastic, and a real eye-opener, helping our team
level up their scalable CSS architecture skills. The entire team left it
learning something new, and to say that what was covered will have a large
impact on our work is an understatement. We can’t recommend him enough.</p><b

So, you want to work together? That’s great! So do I. With over a decade of
professional experience—five of which have been spent consulting for [some of
the world’s largest and most respected brands](/#section:clients)—you’re in safe
hands.

I work with companies to improve web performance across the front-ends of their
products. From consulting to training, development to speaking, from
billion-dollar multinationals to fledgling startups, I take a pragmatic and
business-minded approach to helping organisations do the right things, quickly.
