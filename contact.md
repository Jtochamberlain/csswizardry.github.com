## So, You Want to Send Me an Email?

That’s great! I can’t wait to see what we’ll be discussing. However… I get a lot
of email. A lot. In order to help me help you, please try and observe the
following suggestions:

* If you are a **retainer client**, make use of your priority email address.
* If you are emailing with **unsolicited offers** of link exchanges, writing
  content for my blog, your app development services, etc., I will not return
  a reply. Sorry.
  * If you chase up after several days, I will **mark your email as spam**.
* **State your intentions** clearly and early. If you’re asking for advice,
  that’s absolutely fine, but I can assist you faster if we get straight to the
  point.
* If appropriate (this usually applies to conferences), **begin your email’s
  subject line with the expectations and time commitments** of the message,
  e.g.: <q>[Action Required – <2 minutes] Speaker’s Dinner</q>, or <q>[No Action
  Required] Directions to Venue</q>.
  * Seeing a subject like the former lets me know that you need a reply, and
    that I can probably do it from my phone while I stand in line for a coffee.
    The latter lets me know that the email is purely informational and that
    I don’t need to carve out any time for it.
* If you’re **inviting me to speak** at your event, [this
  list](https://csswizardry.com/speaking/#section:request) will probably be
  useful.

None of the above are strict requirements, but they will generally help me to
triage and manage email and prioritise your response appropriately. They aren’t
points designed to limit access to me, but rather to streamline it.

All set? Here we go:

<p class="u-text-prominent">csswizardry@gmail.com</p>

If I do seem to be taking a while to respond, I would not be at all offended if
you tweeted at me, or sent me a follow-up email, to remind me to reply.
