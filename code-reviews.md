You could be leaving hundreds of thousands of pounds of revenue on the table
every year due to a poorly- or un-optimised website. Slow websites are one of
online consumers’ biggest frustrations, and a fast way to miss out on sales.

Wether you want to boost revenues, improve conversion rates, reduce churn, or
improve retention and engagement, a well-optimised site is a key way to get
there.

**Your website is slow. I can tell you why.**

## How It Works

<p>Harry’s performance audit gave comprehensive, forensic insight across the full delivery pipeline. Clearly highlighted priorities brought rapid benefits and a plan for continued improvement. Genius. </p>

1. **I survey you:** To begin, I need to know a lot about your organisation,
   what problems you feel you face, and what we need to concentrate on. I’ll
   send a series of very focused questions that will help me to understand the
   business’ needs immediately.
2. **You grant me access:** Where possible, I’ll need access to analytics and
   RUM accounts, repositories, staging environments, etc.
3. **I spend a week auditing the site:** Remotely, I roll up my sleeves and dig
   in! With an encyclopaedic knowledge of all things web-performance, nothing
   will evade me. From infrastructure and the network to assets and payloads;
   from CSS and fonts to runtime and rendering (and everything in between), we
   have a lot to pay attention to.
4. **I write up my findings:** Once I’ve uncovered everything, I’ll put together
   a full report outlining all of the issues and problems that exist, as well as
   preemptive optimisations we could make in order to be even faster.
5. **We hold a formal handover:** To ensure that all knowledge is fully
   transferred, we’ll run a handover session between all relevant parties.

## Existing Issues and Opportunistic Optimisations

<p>Harry’s focused, practical approach allowed us to implement significant
changes which improved our user experience and overall performance
dramatically. I recommend him wholeheartedly.</p>

As well as uncovering existing issues that are impacting site performance, I’ll
also be sure to make recommendations where opportunistic optimisations are
concerned: are there any new web platform features we can utilise? Different
approaches we could be taking? Bleeding edge features that we can begin to
introduce? **Instead of just making your site better, let’s make it
a class-leader.**

## Deliverables

Once the audit is complete, you receive:

* **Audit Document:** An extensive, detailed report that covers everything that
  the investigation uncovered. It is not uncommon for these audits to run into
  the thousands of words, so I ensure it is broken into clear, thematic sections
  with defined action points. This document becomes the canonical reference for
  your engineering team, and as well as developer-facing, technical insights,
  I will include a business-oriented executive summary that highlights key
  findings and their impact.
* **Performance Backlog:** A Trello board that I populate as I review the site
  will be made available to your team. Cards have clear checklists covering
  everything from common pitfalls to long-term optimisations.
* **Half-Day Handover:** Scheduled for some time after delivery of the report,
  we’ll set aside half a day for a call in which your engineers can ask
  questions about my findings, I can explain anything that requires it, we can
  look to discuss longer-term strategies, and generally close up the project
  with a formal handover session.
